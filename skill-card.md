### License/Terms of Use:

MIT

## Use Case:

External users and sales operators use this skill to manage lead records, generate tailored outreach sequences, queue or send follow-up emails with approval controls, and review pipeline reports from a conversational agent.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Unsafe file-writing patterns and weak automation safeguards could affect real outbound email workflows.

Mitigation: Review shell-writing and automation behavior before installation, and keep the skill in manual-send mode unless the user accepts unattended outreach risk.

Risk: Untrusted text in templates or email bodies can create unsafe or misleading outbound messages.

Mitigation: Avoid placing untrusted text directly into templates or email bodies; require user review of generated drafts before sending.

Risk: Fixed temporary files, heredoc write instructions, outside-workspace probes, and rate-limit counting need review before SMTP or cron automation.

Mitigation: Consider fixing those issues before enabling SMTP sending or cron automation, and verify rate-limit behavior in manual operation first.
